# Placement of Charging Stations

Determining optimal locations to build new electric vehicle charging stations is a complex optimization problem.  Many factors should be taken into consideration, like existing charger locations, points of interest (POIs), quantity to build, etc. In this example, we take a look at how we might formulate this optimization problem and solve it using D-Wave's binary quadratic model (BQM) hybrid solver.
